# Consumer-query-classification
Consumer complaints are produced in large number each day. There lies difficulty in classifying large number of consumer complaints manually especially because of the time constraint. Grievances usually comprises of lengthy texts which takes lots of manpower and time to interpret and classify. Complaints can be filed into wrong categories. Difficulty in going through every single complaint and direct them to relevant departments is to be dealt with. To solve these issues, the proposed model uses machine learning algorithm to learn and classify the complaints into their respective categories .The different machine learning algorithms include logistic regression, linearSVC, multinomialNB, gaussian NB, random forest and each of these models are combined with different GloVe models. From the models, logistic regression is the best suited model with accuracy of 82.93% .Python flask API is used to enable application interaction. The user should enter the consumer complaint in the application, and consumer complaints classification is done, and the accuracy of the complaint classified is displayed.
